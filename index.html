  <h2>The Two Arthurs and the God of Ink</h2>
  <p><em>August 17, 2025</em></p>
  <p>
    What do you get when you cross a French visionary poet with a Welsh mystic of the grotesque? Apparently, two Arthurs and a whole lot of shadow.
    Arthur Rimbaud, the enfant terrible of Symbolism, wrote like he was possessed by a fever dream. Arthur Machen, meanwhile, penned tales that felt like they were whispered by ancient stones in forgotten catacombs.
  </p>
  <p>
    Both Arthurs were obsessed with the unseen—Rimbaud with the inner alchemy of the soul, Machen with the outer horrors that lurk just beyond the veil. Their works pulse with the same occult heartbeat, as if Thoth himself had dipped his quill into the abyss and scribbled their names side by side.
  </p>
  <p>
    Coincidence? Or cosmic pun? Perhaps the universe just likes the name Arthur. Maybe it’s short for “Art-horror.” Or “Ar-thirst,” for forbidden knowledge. Either way, these two scribes remind us that literature is a séance—and every page is a summoning.
